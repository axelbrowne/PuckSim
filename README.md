# PuckSim

A passion project modeling the multi-generational genetic inheritance of fish-resembling “puck” agents written in Java and utilizing its Abstract Window Toolkit library.
Agents seek food using "smell" and "sight," mate with other agents, and nurse offspring to adulthood. Agents inherit traits from their parents with a chance of mutation; stats and agent behavior are affected by these genetic traits.

Inspired by SethBling's "Genetic Evolution in Minecraft 1.14" [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aIp5DdnKwM).
