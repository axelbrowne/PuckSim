# PuckSim

[Video Explanation for v1.0](https://youtu.be/AvIlGguYQxE).

A passion project inspired by my interests in genetic evolution, agent modeling, 
emergient special behaviors, and a video of [Genetic Evolution in Minecraft 1.14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aIp5DdnKwM)
by Sethbling on YouTube.

## Description:
PuckSim visually models the multi-generational genetic inheritance of fish-resembling
“puck” agents in Java, using its Abstract Window Toolkit library. Agents seek food using "smell"
and "sight," mate with other agents, and nurse offspring to adulthood in a two-dimensional,
top-down, grid-less environment. Agents inherit traits from their parents with a chance of
mutation; stats and agent behavior are affected by these genetic traits.
