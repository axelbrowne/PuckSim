# PuckSim

A passion project modeling the multi-generational genetic inheritance of fish-resembling “puck” agents written in Java and utilizing its Abstract Window Toolkit library.
Agents seek food using "smell" and "sight," mate with other agents, and nurse offspring to adulthood in a two-dimensional, top-down, grid-less environment. Agents inherit traits from their parents with a chance of mutation; stats and agent behavior are affected by these genetic traits.
